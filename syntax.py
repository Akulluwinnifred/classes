#variable syntax for python(# represents a comment)
#names of variables should not start with special characters e.g(#number,@,$)
#variable names should not start with a numerical number e.g(1number,2number) 
#however number1,number2 is valid
# a variable name should not have spaces between them e.g(my name,my age)
#composite variable names should be seperated by an underscore e.g(my_name,my_age)
#or you can use camel-case notation e.g(myName,myAge)
#names should not start with capital letters unless they are functions or classes
#we should use relatable names 
#use shorter names e.g(cust for customer,age instead of myAge)
#variable names should not be repeated in different forms because python is case sensitive e.g('Name' and 'name' are not the same)
name="winnifred"
age=27
mygender= "female" 
print(name)
my_name="Akullu"
print(my_name)
print(mygender)
#declaring variables is a process of naming computer memory spaces
#initializing a variable is the process of giving variables a value e.g(age is a variable,27 is its value)
country="Uganda"
#the equal sign is called asignment operator
