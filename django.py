#MVC allows developers to separate the application into three components: Model, View and Controller. 
#Model-The model represents the data that your app will be working with. It's responsible for accessing the database and performing CRUD operations
#we use methods to capture data
#views are files that will be handling requests and  returning responses
#A model is anything related to a database(models.py)
#views in views.py
#controllers are for urls which determines which views to load and views determines which models to manipulate
